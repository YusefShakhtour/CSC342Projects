Final Thoughts:
I was very pround of my newspaper landing page. I feel it really did give off a clean and professional look. On the other hand, my dashboard was not where I wanted it to be. The nav bar at the top looked sloppy and unfinished. The sidebar was pretty good, but it was just awkward whenever you scrolled. The info at the bottom looked okay, but just felt boring and stacked on top of one another. Overall, the project was a good experience and for my first time, not terrible, but not great. I will ensure I get going earlier on the next homework and take better advantage of office hours.
