Final Thoughts:
Really interesting project. Did not really enjoy it as much as HW2, probably because I was stuck on something every other minutes which was very discouraging. At the same time though, had I gotten started a bit earlier and made better use of office hours, things would have gone a lot smoother. The styling on this project was not where I wanted it to be, although I do believe it met expectations because there were not really any expectation for a polished site/webpage. But the backend and actual validation portion of the assignment, I think I did well on and definently learned a whole lot.
