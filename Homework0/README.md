# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think ungrading should be much more widespread. If I recall correctly, there have been various studies on ungrading and students are happier and usually able to learn much more from a class that is ungrades as opposed to traditional grading. 

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I'm slightly hesitant. From what I know about similar practices, quanitative feedback is not entirely thrown out the window. I believe an example would be Finland schools who still have quanitaive practices, but just don't put as much emphasis on it and focus much more on learning and growth.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
