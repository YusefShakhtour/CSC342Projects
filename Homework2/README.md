Final Thoughts:
I really enjoyed this project. I feel I gained a lot with regrad to the basics of Javascript and also helped in refining my HTML and CSS skills. This actually surprised me as making a basic calculator just sounds like something I consider myself overqualified for. But in the context of learning entirely new technologies and a new syntax, it was a great starter project.
