Final Thoughts:
Overall, this project was pretty straightforward. I unfortunately didn't have time to edit HW4 to add proper authentication, 
but my HW5 is fully functional and the token is a proper JWT. It's definently valuable to know how to properly secure things
like a cookie for a web application. Makes things easier on the user and is just, in general an imporant part of web development.
I should be able to gain more exposure with proper security/authentication with the group project and really have that part 
of we development figured out. 
Overall, this project was good for getting some hand on exposure to authentication.
